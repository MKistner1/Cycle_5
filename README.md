Contact List

Description: This is a javaframe application created in netbeans that locallu stores contact information that the user inputs. Along with
having a storage space for contacts other than your phone, the end goal was to allow the user to email and text yourself the contact information based on the information you used to create an account. However, I had trouble get the APIs (javax.mail and twilio) to work with the project so those functions do not work.

Dependencies: NetBeans IDE, mysql connector, twilio api, javax.mail api, and activation api to function with the mail api

Usage: The use this project is for people to have an alternative storage spave for contact information rather than just their phone. I
always here about people losing their contacts when they get a new phone so that is where I got the idea.

Future work: I can do a lot to improve on the look an feel of the app. As of now it is a very minmal application that has a lot of areas to
improve on like security of the app and functionality of it.

This is related to my course work because it links together java and sql languages to create one project.
